  "articleBody": "Abstract This project is a project on the topic on creating a stylized ocean environment in Unreal Engine 5. It consist of multiple areas of shader works including waves, water effects, WPO animation shaders, postprocessing effects, and multiple other shaders, all designed for underwater scene. Additonally, this project utilizes UE5’s Niagara particle system and its Neighbour grid3D to improve performance for simulating the movement of fish schools using the boids algorithm. Using the custom shaders and particle systems, I built an ocean environment, showcased from 2 different perspectives.\nPreface In this article, I will briefly go through the following techniques I’ve experimented with, the issues I’ve encountered, and their remedies separated into several stages in chronological order.\nThe area of coverage is larger than I initially expected. With that being said, it’s possible that I have made some mistakes and misunderstanding, in which case, please feel free to correct my understanding　(´・ω・｀).\nYou can also visit my repository here at fishies\nImplementation and Stages Part 1: Waves - Sine Waves, Gerstner Waves, Scrolling waves Waves Initially, this project was meant to only be focused on this section, making a simple ocean waves simulation where I try a few techniques on implementing wave shaders.\nfigure 01: Waves testing room\rThe idea of animating ocean-wave in general is to offset the vertices of the ocean-wave plane in a specific direction using a wave function. From here, we can use wave superposition by adding multiple waves with different amplitudes, wavelength, speed, etc.. together to create a more interesting shape. For this part, I’ve tried 2 different implementations.\nSine Waves The first implementation I’ve tried my hands on is using sine waves where I offset the plane’s vertices in z direction only. This is probably the simplest method that uses World Position Offset for simulating waves.\nfigure 02: Sine waves\rGerstner Waves The second method here I tried and decided to use is gerstner waves, this method creates a more realistic waves with sharper peaks and wider trough. In contrary to the sine wave implementation, this wave offset moves the waves vertex in all xyz direction.\nfigure 03: Gerstner waves\rComparing the two waves One of the benefits of using Gerstner waves is that, waves here creates wider trough than the sine waves.\nHowever, this does not come without a drawback. When the steepness value gets too high $(\u003e1)$ the wave will curl upon itself. (There are modified versions of sine wave that gives wider trough too but I didn’t use that.)\nfigure 04: Gerstner waves curling on itself\rFor this implementation, I choose to continue with gerstner wave since it produces sharper peaks and also that I simply wanted to try it out.\nCalculating wave normals After the offset are calculated, I use cross product of the Binormal and Bitangent to calculate the normal vector where binormal and bitangent can be derived from the partial derivative of the x and y offset function. Luckily for my case, the literature from GPU Gems have already provided the complete form of the normal vector calculation which saved alot of time.\nExtra effects - Scrolling wave normals Scrolling textures: Now to improve the visuals I have added scrolling textures as additional normals to give the waves surface a more interesting look.\nFresnel: Afterwards, a Fresnel term is added to ensure the wave is more opaque (more reflection) when viewing at a near-grazing incedence.\nDepth-Opacity: To make the object underwater look less visible when it is deeper, an opacity-based depth is also calculated using scene-depth (translucent-material ignored) - pixel-depth (translucent material tested) and scale it down by the desired depth factor. This gives a good impression of depth under water surface.\nRefraction: For refraction, I just set it to water’s refraction index which is 1.33. Now we can combine these method and make a pretty nice waves/water shader.\nfigure 05: Sum of Gerstner waves with added effects\rfigure 06: Sum of Gerstner waves with view from above and grazing incidence\rIssues, Remedies, and Considerations Two sided waves However, given that our wave is translucent. Since Unreal Engine uses Deferred rendering, the backface of the translucent waves are no longer culled giving a triangle looking visual artifacts.\nfigure 07: Backface artifacts\rTo remedy this issue, I instead uses 2 water plane, made the material one-sided and disable the depth effect on the under-side of water where the under side does not use depth opacity check.\nfigure 08: Double plane wave\rMesh density and Nanite The quality of the wave depends on the mesh density using this world position offset method. This means if this method were to be implement for a game, we should use higher vertex density mesh near the player or use a custom tesselation shader.\nfigure 09: Mesh density\rI have to note that unreal engine’s nanite cannot be applied to this also since we uses the world position offset on the wave’s vertices and nanite would change the vertex position and density in a highly undesirable way.\nfigure 10: Nanite Comparision\rBlurring and Anti-Aliasing When setting anti-aliasing to TSR, the blurring issue became very visible the higher the amount intensity the scrolling normal is. By lowering the scrolling normal intensity, the wave’s tiling effects became more visible. And when switching to FXAA, there are undesirable sharpness. I have yet to find a nice and balanced fix for this one.\nfigure 11: High-intensity normal TSR, Low-intensity normal TSR, FXAA\rTiling and Alternatives Both method of offsetting wave here introduces the undesirable effects of tiling. In this example it looks alright since it kind of resembles a calm ocean. However it cannot be denied that at certain angles the tiling became visible.\nfigure 12: Tiling\rThis means if we want a more realistic simulation, certain techniques suchas oceanographic spectra and FFT.\nFinal Implementation figure 13: Nodes and custom HLSL\rPart 2: Fishes - Boids figure 14: Boids test room\rBoids Boids (bird-oid object) or a way to simulate flocking behaviour based on set of rules. There are three main factors when it comes to boids.\nRules Description Separation Each particle avoids each other Alignment Each particle steers in the direction of the flock Cohesion Each particle steers towards the center of the flock With these three rules, the particle will form an emerging behaviour\nNeighbor Grid3D To accelerate boids for real time use, I chose to use UE5’s built in Neighbor Grid3D inspired by this video from Ghislain Girardot (his visual debugger is super useful). Since I have never implemented this data structure myself, I will not go into details but here are the premises and use case of it.\nThe Neighbor Grid3D appears to be an implementation of a Bounded Spatial Hash Grid where the regions are divided into identical sized cells in xyz, direction. To figure out which cell the particle is in, you can applying a function based on the particle position which is stored inside a flatten 1d array. To make the flatten position works for dense grid, there are multiple techniques employed such as partial/prefix sum and so on…\nIn our use case, from there forward you can fetch the desired data of the neighbouring particle by iterating through the neighboring cells. (I’m glossing over a whole lot of things.)\nThis is particulary useful for things that utilizes local particle interaction rather than global interactions which makes it especially useful for fluid simulations, and in our case, boids.\nBase Rules Force In this implementation, the Neighbour Grid3D is used to fetch the cell of the current particle. Afterwards, I loop through the neighbouring cells index of the current cell and then iterates through each neighbouring particle in the cells.\nAfter we get the neighboring particle positions, we calculate whether the particle is in the field of view using the dot product of the normalized current particle velocity and the direction of the current particle position to the neighbour.\nIf the neighboring particle is in the FOV, we can calculate the following forces.\n// Calculate separation value float separationRatio = 1 - clamp(length(directionParticleToNbrs) / inSeparationFalloff, 0, 1); if (separationRatio \u003e 1e-5) { outSeparationForce -= separationRatio * directionParticleToNbrs; // -= since we are avoiding separationCount += 1.0; } // Calculate alignment value (flock direction) float alignmentRatio = 1 - clamp(length(directionParticleToNbrs) / inAlignmentFalloff, 0, 1); if (alignmentRatio \u003e 1e-5) { outAlignmentForce += alignmentRatio * normalize(nbrsVelocity); alignmentCount += 1.0; } // Calculate Cohesion value (flock center of mass) float cohesionRatio = (1 - clamp(length(directionParticleToNbrs) / inCohesionFalloff, 0, 1)) ? 1 : 0; if (cohesionRatio \u003e 1e-5) { outCohesionForce += nbrsPos * cohesionRatio; cohesionCount += 1.0; } We then take each ratio and divide them by the total count of particle, normalize the value, then scale it by a user defined factor.\nfigure 15: 1 species boids\rExtra force: Introducing several species, Predator-Prey force calculation Boids species are distributed based on a user-defined curve.\nfigure 16: User parameters\rThe rule in this implementation is simple and forces calculated very similary for intra species boids.\nFor particles that are in different species, they will avoid each other and will not align or cohese.\nfigure 17: 2 species boids figure 18: 2 species boids figure 19: 3 species boids For Predator-Prey system, the prey will try to avoid predator and predator will try to follow prey. This, in my implementation however does not go well at all so I’ve decided to not use it.\nBoundary Force: Setting boundaries I use 3 ways initially to create boundary for keeping boids inside.\nfigure 20: 3 boundaries The first method uses a box scaled by the scale of the particle system. If the particle goes out of bound, it will immediately reflects back in. This creates an undesirable effect of extremely sharp turn.\nThe second method also uses a box but then only apply forces when the particle goes out of bound for a smoother turn.\nThe third method creates a spherical region where the particles inside the region will not be affected by the force. However, when the particle leaves the region, it will apply a weak force to increase the tendency of particles to stay inside the region.\nApplying Forces The forces are applied into 2 stages\nfigure 21: Niagara system Base Rule Force and Extra Force are added together with the velocity, scaled by delta time and a constant speed. (This somewhat gives a smoother movement)\nThen in another pass the same is done with Boundary Force, this is to ensure the bounding force stays relatively strong.\nWPO animation on fish vertex The animation is done simply by using a simple wave function to offset the world positon\nfigure 22: Sacabambaspis I should’ve vertex paint the face to mask the movement but it looks funnier this way (this mask doesn’t work in niagara system so the whole fish moves).\nFinal Implementation and Realization This made me realize boids are so difficult to control and to make it work as desired.. The predator-prey system is difficulty to fine tune and would require quite more polishing to work properly. So for the final implementation I opted in to use the simple multi-species instead.\nPart 3: Effects and Props - Caustics, Post-Processing, Foilage WPO animation, Setting up final scenes Caustics Since calculating caustics aren’t computationally cheap. The features of caustics are imitated with 2 textures.\nThe first texture is the base caustics, created using 2 4D smooth f1 voronois of the same position setup subtracing the one with lower scale, this create a smooth pattern resembling caustics (This technique is based on Deayan Studios).\nTo make it tileable, I put the UV positions through trig functions and added to the 4D voronoi function. The first texture is then baked using the add-on I wrote texture patisserie\nUsing the same setup, I created 3 other textures with minimal offset in xy direction to combine and create chromatic abberation effect.\nfigure 23: Caustics Texture The other texture is simply a scrolling wave texture which is added into the UV position of caustics to distort it.\nfigure 24: Caustics Material figure 25: Caustics decals\rIf this were to be improved upon, we can maybe project the caustics based on the sun’s position\nPost-Processing, Depth, Distance fog The post procesing effect uses distance fog based on the depth buffer to make position further away from screen become less visible. This however poses one issue, meaning that for areas above the ground, the sky, the sun will be entirely invisible.\nfigure 26: Opaque area above the waves\rTo remedy this issue, I have a few ideas\nMethod 1: Ray-Plane intersection against sea level Drawing a ray plane intersection test based on sea level to see if the direction that ray points to is above the sea level or not.\nTo do this, world position must be reconstructed from depth. The distance from screen to the position is then compared with the distance from screen to the sea level to determine is the area above the sea is visible. For this project, I did not choose this method.\nMethod 2: Custom depth pass In this method I chose to create a few objects that only draw to the custom depth pass (non-colliding, does not draw to main pass). I then set the scene and moves the mesh with custom depth to the desired sea level. This actually worked quite well lol. Although this method is not universal, this is simple and quick to setup so I opted to use this one.\nfigure 27: Hiding custom depth masking object from main pass figure 28: scene vs custom depth figure 29: visualizing using custom depth as mask figure 30: figure26 after using custom depth I’ve also added the sea-level based depth color which simply uses the sea-level and lerp the color based on how far one is from the sea-level. As per future improvement, if the method 1 is used, we could also get a nice gradient as well.\nThe final post-processing object is now done with the custom depth pass governing the scene depth based visibility and the distance form sea level governing the color.\nfigure 31: Combining both effects figure 32: Post-Processing material Seagrass WPO animation - Global wind, Localwind figure 33: Seagrass material For local offset, I just use a standard wave function to offset the leaves locally.\nFor global wind, I just used a few normal wave funcitions for this, one to mask the position of the wind in sections. The other to move the wind, both are simple implementations of wave function.\nfigure 34: grass wind WPO Setting up final scenes I first defined the camera position and since the waves, post-processing material, and caustics are already done I put them into the scene first during the grey-boxing stage.\nfigure 35: Grey Boxing Here I just sculpt and decimated the rock mesh and using thin cards for foliage. The materials are then later baked and exported.\nfigure 36: Assets and Texture Baking\rHere I swapped out blockouts, added in boids, and do some final light adjustments.\nfigure 37: Scene Integration\rAnd Done!\nfigure 38: Final Scene\rReferences https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-i-natural-effects/chapter-1-effective-water-simulation-physical-models https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9q0HNBjT4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGEqaX4Y4bQ https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/boids.html https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/labs/s2021/Boids/Boids.html https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/11-hashing.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82asza6Kv24 https://www.youtube.com/@BenCloward ",

<p>This project is a project on the topic on creating a stylized ocean environment in Unreal Engine 5. It consist of multiple areas of shader works including <strong>waves, water effects, WPO animation shaders, postprocessing effects</strong>, and multiple other shaders, all designed for underwater scene. Additonally, this project utilizes <strong>UE5&rsquo;s Niagara particle system</strong> and its <strong>Neighbour grid3D</strong> to improve performance for simulating the movement of fish schools using the <strong>boids algorithm</strong>. Using the custom shaders and particle systems, I built an ocean environment, showcased from 2 different perspectives.</p>

<h3 id="waves">Waves<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#waves">#</a></h3>
<p>Initially, this project was meant to only be focused on this section, making a simple ocean waves simulation where I try a few techniques on implementing wave shaders.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="/002_fishies/01_waves/01_waves_test_room.webp" loading="lazy" alt="waves_test_room">
    <br>
    <i>figure 01: Waves testing room</i>
    </p>
<br>
<p>The idea of animating ocean-wave in general is to offset the vertices of the ocean-wave plane in a specific direction using a wave function. From here, we can use wave superposition by adding multiple waves with different amplitudes, wavelength, speed, etc.. together to create a more interesting shape. For this part, I&rsquo;ve tried 2 different implementations.</p>
<h3 id="sine-waves">Sine Waves<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sine-waves">#</a></h3>
<p>The first implementation I&rsquo;ve tried my hands on is using sine waves where I offset the plane&rsquo;s vertices in z direction only. This is probably the simplest method that uses World Position Offset for simulating waves.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="/002_fishies/01_waves/02_sine_waves.webp" loading="lazy" alt="sine_waves">
    <br>

    </p>
<br>
<h3 id="gerstner-waves">Gerstner Waves<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#gerstner-waves">#</a></h3>
<p>The second method here I tried and decided to use is gerstner waves, this method creates a more realistic waves with sharper peaks and wider trough. In contrary to the sine wave implementation, this wave offset moves the waves vertex in all xyz direction.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="/002_fishies/01_waves/03_gerstner_waves.webp" loading="lazy" alt="gerstner_waves">

<br>
<h3 id="comparing-the-two-waves">Comparing the two waves<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#comparing-the-two-waves">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the benefits of using Gerstner waves is that, waves here creates wider trough than the sine waves.</p>
<p>However, this does not come without a  drawback. When the steepness value gets too high $(&gt;1)$ the wave will curl upon itself.
(There are modified versions of sine wave that gives wider trough too but I didn&rsquo;t use that.)</p>
<p align="center">

    <br>
    <i>figure 04: Gerstner waves curling on itself</i>
    </p>
<br>
<p>For this implementation, I choose to continue with gerstner wave since it produces sharper peaks and also that I simply wanted to try it out.</p>
<h3 id="calculating-wave-normals">Calculating wave normals<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#calculating-wave-normals">#</a></h3>
<p>After the offset are calculated, I use cross product of the Binormal and Bitangent to calculate the normal vector where binormal and bitangent can be derived from the partial derivative of the x and y offset function. Luckily for my case, the literature from GPU Gems have already provided the complete form of the normal vector calculation which saved alot of time.</p>
<h3 id="extra-effects---scrolling-wave-normals">Extra effects - Scrolling wave normals<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#extra-effects---scrolling-wave-normals">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Scrolling textures:</strong> Now to improve the visuals I have added scrolling textures as additional normals to give the waves surface a more interesting look.</p>
<p><strong>Fresnel:</strong> Afterwards, a Fresnel term is added to ensure the wave is more opaque (more reflection) when viewing at a near-grazing incedence.</p>
<p><strong>Depth-Opacity:</strong> To make the object underwater look less visible when it is deeper, an opacity-based depth is also calculated using scene-depth (translucent-material ignored) - pixel-depth (translucent material tested)
and scale it down by the desired depth factor. This gives a good impression of depth under water surface.</p>
<p><strong>Refraction:</strong> For refraction, I just set it to water&rsquo;s refraction index which is 1.33.
Now we can combine these method and make a pretty nice waves/water shader.</p>

<h4 id="two-sided-waves">Two sided waves<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#two-sided-waves">#</a></h4>
<p>However, given that our wave is translucent. Since Unreal Engine uses Deferred rendering, the backface of the translucent waves are no longer culled giving a triangle looking visual artifacts.</p>
<p align="center">

    <br>
    <i>figure 07: Backface artifacts</i>
    </p>
<br>
<p>To remedy this issue, I instead uses 2 water plane, made the material one-sided and disable the depth effect on the under-side of water where the under side does not use depth opacity check.</p>

<br>
<h4 id="mesh-density-and-nanite">Mesh density and Nanite<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#mesh-density-and-nanite">#</a></h4>
<p>The quality of the wave depends on the mesh density using this world position offset method. This means if this method were to be implement for a game, we should use higher vertex density mesh near the player or use a custom tesselation shader.</p>
<p align="center">

    </p>
<br>
<p>I have to note that unreal engine&rsquo;s nanite cannot be applied to this also since we uses the world position offset on the wave&rsquo;s vertices and nanite would change the vertex position and density in a highly undesirable way.</p>

<h4 id="blurring-and-anti-aliasing">Blurring and Anti-Aliasing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#blurring-and-anti-aliasing">#</a></h4>
<p>When setting anti-aliasing to TSR, the blurring issue became very visible the higher the amount intensity the scrolling normal is. By lowering the scrolling normal intensity, the wave&rsquo;s tiling effects became more visible. And when switching to FXAA, there are undesirable sharpness. I have yet to find a nice and balanced fix for this one.</p>

<p>Both method of offsetting wave here introduces the undesirable effects of tiling. In this example it looks alright since it kind of resembles a calm ocean. However it cannot be denied that at certain angles the tiling became visible.</p>

<p>Boids (bird-oid object) or a way to simulate flocking behaviour based on set of rules. There are three main factors when it comes to boids.</p>

<p>With these three rules, the particle will form an emerging behaviour</p>
<h3 id="neighbor-grid3d">Neighbor Grid3D<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#neighbor-grid3d">#</a></h3>
<p>To accelerate boids for real time use, I chose to use UE5&rsquo;s built in Neighbor Grid3D inspired by this video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82asza6Kv24">Ghislain Girardot</a> (his visual debugger is super useful). Since I have never implemented this data structure myself, I will not go into details but here are the premises and use case of it.</p>
<p>The Neighbor Grid3D appears to be an implementation of a Bounded Spatial Hash Grid where the regions are divided into identical sized cells in xyz, direction. To figure out which cell the particle is in, you can applying a function based on the particle position which is stored inside a flatten 1d array.
To make the flatten position works for dense grid, there are multiple techniques employed such as partial/prefix sum and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>In our use case, from there forward you can fetch the desired data of the neighbouring particle by iterating through the neighboring cells. (I&rsquo;m glossing over a whole lot of things.)</p>
<p>This is particulary useful for things that utilizes local particle interaction rather than global interactions which makes it especially useful for fluid simulations, and in our case, boids.</p>
<h3 id="base-rules-force">Base Rules Force<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#base-rules-force">#</a></h3>
<p>In this implementation, the Neighbour Grid3D is used to fetch the cell of the current particle. Afterwards, I loop through the neighbouring cells index of the current cell and then iterates through each neighbouring particle in the cells.</p>
<p>After we get the neighboring particle positions, we calculate whether the particle is in the field of view using the dot product of the normalized current particle velocity and the direction of the current particle position to the neighbour.</p>
<p>If the neighboring particle is in the FOV, we can calculate the following forces.</p>

<p>The first method uses a box scaled by the scale of the particle system. If the particle goes out of bound, it will immediately reflects back in. This creates an undesirable effect of extremely sharp turn.</p>

<p>The third method creates a spherical region where the particles inside the region will not be affected by the force. However, when the particle leaves the region, it will apply a weak force to increase the tendency of particles to stay inside the region.</p>

<p>The forces are applied into 2 stages</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Base Rule Force</strong> and <strong>Extra Force</strong> are added together with the velocity, scaled by delta time and a constant speed. (This somewhat gives a smoother movement)</p>
<p>Then in another pass the same is done with <strong>Boundary Force</strong>, this is to ensure the bounding force stays relatively strong.</p>

<p>I should&rsquo;ve vertex paint the face to mask the movement but it looks funnier this way (this mask doesn&rsquo;t work in niagara system so the whole fish moves).</p>

<p>This made me realize boids are so difficult to control and to make it work as desired..
The predator-prey system is difficulty to fine tune and would require quite more polishing to work properly. So for the final implementation I opted in to use the simple multi-species instead.</p>

<h3 id="caustics">Caustics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#caustics">#</a></h3>
<p>Since calculating caustics aren&rsquo;t computationally cheap. The features of caustics are <em>imitated</em> with 2 textures.</p>
<p>The first texture is the base caustics, created using 2 4D smooth f1 voronois of the same position setup subtracing the one with lower scale, this create a smooth pattern resembling caustics (This technique is based on Deayan Studios).</p>
<p>To make it tileable, I put the UV positions through trig functions and added to the 4D voronoi function. The first texture is then baked using the add-on I wrote <a href="/posts/003_texture_patisserie/"><strong>texture patisserie</strong></a></p>
<p>Using the same setup, I created 3 other textures with minimal offset in xy direction to combine and create chromatic abberation effect.</p>

<br>
<p>The other texture is simply a scrolling wave texture which is added into the UV position of caustics to distort it.</p>

<p>If this were to be improved upon, we can maybe project the caustics based on the sun&rsquo;s position</p>

<p>The post procesing effect uses distance fog based on the depth buffer to make position further away from screen become less visible. This however poses one issue, meaning that for areas above the ground, the sky, the sun will be entirely invisible.</p>

    <br>

<br>
<p>To remedy this issue, I have a few ideas</p>
<h4 id="method-1-ray-plane-intersection-against-sea-level">Method 1: Ray-Plane intersection against sea level<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#method-1-ray-plane-intersection-against-sea-level">#</a></h4>
<p>Drawing a ray plane intersection test based on sea level to see if the direction that ray points to is above the sea level or not.</p>
<p>To do this, world position must be reconstructed from depth. The distance from screen to the position is then compared with the distance from screen to the sea level to determine is the area above the sea is visible. For this project, I did not choose this method.</p>
<h4 id="method-2-custom-depth-pass">Method 2: Custom depth pass<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#method-2-custom-depth-pass">#</a></h4>
<p>In this method I chose to create a few objects that only draw to the custom depth pass (non-colliding, does not draw to main pass). I then set the scene and moves the mesh with custom depth to the desired sea level. This actually worked quite well lol. Although this method is not universal, this is simple and quick to setup so I opted to use this one.</p>

<br>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also added the sea-level based depth color which simply uses the sea-level and lerp the color based on how far one is from the sea-level. As per future improvement, if the method 1 is used, we could also get a nice gradient as well.</p>
<p>The final post-processing object is now done with the custom depth pass governing the scene depth based visibility and the distance form sea level governing the color.</p>

<p>For local offset, I just use a standard wave function to offset the leaves locally.</p>
